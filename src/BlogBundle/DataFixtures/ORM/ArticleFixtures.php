                            I was looking at all the life. 
                            There were plants and birds. and rocks and things, 
                            There was sand and hills and rings. 
                            The first thing I met, was a fly with a buzz, 
                            And the sky, with no clouds. 
                            The heat was hot, and the ground was dry, 
                            But the air was full of sound. 

                            Ive been through the desert on a horse with no name, 
                            It felt good to be out of the rain.
                            In the desert you can remember your name, 
                            Cause there aint no one for to give you no pain. 

                            After two days, in the desert sun, 
                            My skin began to turn red. 
                            After three days, in the desert fun, 
                            I was looking at a river bed. 
                            And the story it told, of a river that flowed, 
                            Made me sad to think it was dead. 

                            You see Ive been through the desert on a horse with no name, 
                            It felt good to be out of the rain. 
                            In the desert you can remember your name, 
                            Cause there aint no one for to give you no pain. 

                            After nine days, I let the horse run free, 
                            Cause the desert had turned to sea. 
                            There were plants and birds, and rocks and things, 
                            There was sand and hills and rings. 
                            The ocean is a desert, with its life underground, 
                            And a perfect disguise above. 
                            Under the cities lies, a heart made of ground, 
                            But the humans will give no love. 

                            You see Ive been through the desert on a horse with no name, 
                            It felt good to be out of the rain. 
                            In the desert you can remember your name,

                            And thats what tortures me.

                            Around you have grown
                            And accept it that soon
                            Youll be drenched to the bone.
                            If your time to you
                            Is worth savin

                            Who prophesize with your pen

                            The chance wont come again
                            And dont speak too soon
                            For the wheels still in spin
                            And theres no tellin who
                            That its namin.

                            Dont stand in the doorway
                            Dont block up the hall
                            For he that gets hurt
                            Will be he who has stalled
                            Theres a battle outside
                            And it is ragin.
                            Itll soon shake your windows
                            And rattle your walls
                            For the times they are a-changin.

                            Come mothers and fathers
                            Throughout the land
                            And dont criticize
                            What you cant understand
                            Your sons and your daughters
                            Are beyond your command
                            Your old road is
                            Rapidly agin.
                            Please get out of the new one
                            If you cant lend your hand
                            For the times they are a-changin.

                            The line it is drawn
                            The curse it is cast
                            The slow one now
                            Will later be fast
